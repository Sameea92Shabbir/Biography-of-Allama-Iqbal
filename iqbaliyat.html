                <p class="firstpara"><b>Biography</b> Allama Iqbal,in full Sir Muhammad Iqbal, also spelled Muhammad Ikbal, (born November 9, 1877, Sialkot, Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died April 21, 1938, Lahore, Punjab), poet and philosopher known for his influential efforts to direct his fellow Muslims in British-administered India toward the establishment of a separate Muslim state, an aspiration that was eventually realized in the country of Pakistan. He was knighted in 1922.

                    life and career
                    Iqbal was born at Sialkot, India (now in Pakistan), of a pious family of small merchants and was educated at Government College, Lahore. In Europe from 1905 to 1908, he earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge, qualified as a barrister in London, and received a doctorate from the University of Munich. His thesis, The Development of Metaphysics in Persia, revealed some aspects of Islamic mysticism formerly unknown in Europe.
                    
                    On his return from Europe, he gained his livelihood by the practice of law, but his fame came from his Persian- and Urdu-language poetry, which was written in the classical style for public recitation. Through poetic symposia and in a milieu in which memorizing verse was customary, his poetry became widely known.
                    
                    Before he visited Europe, his poetry affirmed Indian nationalism, as in Nayā shawālā (“The New Altar”), but time away from India caused him to shift his perspective. He came to criticize nationalism for a twofold reason: in Europe it had led to destructive racism and imperialism, and in India it was not founded on an adequate degree of common purpose. In a speech delivered at Aligarh in 1910, under the title “Islam as a Social and Political Ideal,” he indicated the new Pan-Islamic direction of his hopes. The recurrent themes of Iqbal’s poetry are a memory of the vanished glories of Islam, a complaint about its present decadence, and a call to unity and reform. Reform can be achieved by strengthening the individual through three successive stages:
                     obedience to the law of Islam, self-control, and acceptance of the idea that everyone is potentially a vicegerent of God (nāʾib, or muʾmin). Furthermore, the life of action is to be preferred to ascetic resignation.Muhammad Iqbal, also known as Allama Iqbal, is the National Poet of Pakistan. A poet, philosopher, politician, lawyer, and scholar, Iqbal was born on November 9, 1877, in Punjab, Pakistan, to Kashmiri parents and educated at Scotch Mission College in Sialkot. He received BAs in philosophy, English literature, and Arabic at Government College University, where he was awarded the Khan Bhadurddin F. S. Jalaluddin medal. In 1905, Iqbal worked closely with Sir Thomas Arnold while studying philosophy at Trinity College Cambridge in England.

                     Having written a treatise on economics, Iqbal also wrote the Urdu ghazal Sare Jahan se Achccha Hindostan Hamara, which became a rallying cry against the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustan (present-day Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan), eventually became a patriotic ballad sung largely in India. 
                     
                     Iqbal is widely known as one of the most important figures in Urdu and Persian literature, having written numerous volumes of poetry in both languages. After returning to Lahore in 1908, Iqbal taught philosophy and English literature while practicing law. His first book, Asrár-I Khudí (The Secrets of the Self), was published in 1915, followed by Ramuz-e-Bekhudi (The Mysteries of Selflessness) in 1918—both of which are regarded as the base for his poetic philosophy. He continued to write and publish volumes of poetry up until his death on April 21, 1938. </p>

            <p class="secondpara"><b>Iqbal and Pakistan</b>Prelude
                Allama Mohammad Iqbal was born on 9th November 1877 in Sialkot. After seeking early education, he was admitted to Government College Lahore, where he obtained M.A. degree in Philosophy. He left for England for higher studies in 1905. In 1907, he obtained the Degree of Doctorate (Ph.D.) from Munich University.
                Iqbal's Role in Pakistan Movement
                Following are some key areas where Allam Iqbal's role led to Pakistan's creation.
                
                Iqbal's Idea about Nationhood
                Allama Iqbal was the greatest philospher and poet of the present era. Alongwith this, he possessed a view about political affairs. He awakened the feeling of Muslim Nationhood among the Muslims of India through his poetry and told them about the propaganda of West about Muslims.
                When the Hindu philosphers presented this philosphy that a nation is born throughout the country and when Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madni seconded it, then Iqbal reacted strongly towards it. His thinking and poetry reflect the Two Nation Theory and his poetry awakened the feeling of Islamic nationality among the Muslims of India. This sense of a single unity was a major factor in the creation of Pakistan.<br/>Allama Iqbal firmly believed that the Muslims of India have a separate identity and to protect this identity, the establishment of a separate homeland for the Muslims of India was necessary. On 28th March 1909, he rejected the invitation from the secular party "Minswa Lodge" highligting the fact that:
                "I have been a keen supporter of this theory that religious differences in this country should end and even now I practise this principle. But, now I have started to believe that separate national identity for the Muslims and the Hindus is necessary for their survival."
                In 1930, in the Annual Session of Muslim League at Allahbad, Iqbal said:
                "India is a continent of human groups belonging to different races, speaking different languages and professing different religions. Their behaviour is not at all determined by a common race conciousness. I therefore, demand the formation of a consolidated Muslim state in the best intrest of India and Islam."
                Pakistan's Sketch
                Allama Iqbal's Presidential Adress at Allahbad in 1930 determined the political path of the Muslims of sub-continent. In his adress, he in clear words said:
                "I would like to see the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan been combined into a single state".
                He further stated that:
                "The formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim State appears to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of the north west India."
                Thus, Iqbal demanded a sovereign independent Muslim state even before the Muslim League demanded it in Pakistan's Resolution.</p>

        <p class="thirdpara"><b>Allama Iqbal’s Political philosophy</b> Political philosophy is akin to conceptual bedrocks, which lead the basics of states affairs, including the government, laws, legislature, and judicial matters. In Iqbal’s poetry, the formulation of laws in the light of Islamic philosophy can be noticed. Still, one of his magnum opus, ‘The Reconstruction of religious thought in Islam,’ provides a comprehensive outlook regarding Islamic philosophy. The fundamental and centerpiece of his concern are to revamp Islam in the modern age. He was convinced that only Islamic polity has all those credentials required to manage state affairs and curb exploitation in the world. Iqbal opposed the stationary condition of Islamic law as it has not advanced for the last five hundred years. He contends that the progress of humanity is improbable without advancements and changes. He criticizes the pace through which Muslims are embarking on the journey to emulate the West. He believed that ‘the younger generation in Asia and Africa are looking for a fresh orientation of Islam that’s why it is the need of the hour to examine the European thought and deduce how far the European thought can help us revive the Islamic values.’

            Iqbal believes in a ‘spiritual democracy’ in which laws will be established in the sight of Islamic procedure. The religious foundation is a prerequisite in establishing the state as he says, “segregation of religion from politics culminates in tyranny”. It is a dire need for a spiritual interpretation of the universe. The actual objective of the Muslim social order is to preserve the piety of the person and create opportunities for his spiritual progress. The crux of criticism on western democracy lies in the materialistic ends and inadequate ethic and spiritual concerns. Iqbal has regard for classless and divine democracy in which people from all strata of society take advantage, and influential people do not have superiority. Some of the important points of Iqbal’s concept of ‘Spiritual Democracy’ are following,
            Islamic consultative assembly must be put in place to monitor the laws and policies following Islamic Law.
            Parliamentarians are responsible for observing divine law and considering the option of ‘Ijtihad’ for accommodating change following the modern age.
            The whole Muslim World must implement spiritual democracy to attain peace and prosperity.
            Iqbal discourages the concentration of wealth in a few hands. He emphasizes the need for an Islamic economic system to ensure equal distribution of resources and acquire economic uplift.
            He rejected the rule of kingship and feudalism.
              geographical nationality. He was of the view that territorial Nationalism can lead Muslims astray. Some of the important points of Iqbal’s idea of Nationalism are following,
            
            Faith and culture have significant importance for a nation’s building.
            A criterion of land to be a nation is not enough.
            A nation devoid of spiritual basis will be transformed into communalism.
            Usually, nationalists apply artificial means to attain solidarity and unity, but faith can be a more viable source of bonding.
            Brotherhood and unity can be achieved by keeping faith in “Tawheed” and taking Holy Prophet (PBUH) as a sole guide.
            Islamic universalism can be gained through Muslim Nationalism. </p>

    <p class="fourthpara"><b>Literary work</b>
        Main article: Works of Muhammad Iqbal
        Persian
        Iqbal's poetic works are written primarily in Persian rather than Urdu. Among his 12,000 verses of poetry, about 7,000 verses are in Persian.[50] In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the Asrar-i-Khudi اسرارِ خودی (Secrets of the Self) in Persian. The poems emphasize the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.[77] In Asrar-i-Khudi, Iqbal explains his philosophy of "Khudi", or "Self".[50][27] Iqbal's use of the term "Khudi" is synonymous with the word "Rooh" used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in Adam, for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.[50] Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the "Self" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the "Self" to become a vice-regent of God.[50]
        
        Pas Chih Bayed Kard Ay Aqwam-e-Sharq پس چہ باید کرد اے اقوامِ شرق includes the poem "Musafir" مسافر ("The Traveller"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of Islamic laws and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. "Musafir" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the Pashtun people are counselled to learn the "secret of Islam" and to "build up the self" within themselves.[50]
        
        His love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:[79]
        
        گرچہ ہندی در عذوبت شکر است[80]
        
        garchi Hindi dar uzūbat shakkar ast
        
        طرز گفتار دري شيرين تر است
        
        tarz-i guftar-i Dari shirin tar ast        
        Throughout his life, Iqbal would prefer writing in Persian as he believed it allowed him to fully express philosophical concepts, and it gave him a wider audience.[81]
        
        Urdu
        Muhammad Iqbal's The Call of the Marching Bell (بانگِ درا, bang-e-dara), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.[50] The poems he wrote up to 1905—the year he left for England—reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the Urdu language patriotic "Saare Jahan se Accha",[47] and "Tarana-e-Milli" ("The Song of the Community"). The second set of poems date from 1905 to 1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of European society, which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the Ummah, to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.[82]
        
        Iqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, Bal-e-Jibril بالِ جبریل (Wings of Gabriel) is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the kingdom of the Moors. It consists of ghazals, poems, quatrains and epigrams and carries a strong sense of religious passion.[83]        
        
        Iqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days. Some verses of that ghazal are:[50] </p>
